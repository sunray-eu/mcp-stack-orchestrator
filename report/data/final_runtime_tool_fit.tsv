tool	best_for	avoid_for	quality	latency_profile	reliability_notes
mcpx-lsp	Symbol definitions, references, cross-file navigation, refactor planning	Long-term memory or semantic note retrieval	High	Cold start medium-high; query low after warmup	Requires language server warmup; strongest correctness for code navigation.
mcpx-qdrant	Fast semantic recall of coding decisions/snippets across sessions	Rich structured metadata and workflow objects	High	Very low (qdrant search p95 ~3.3ms)	Metadata schema in current wrapper is strict; text-only stores reliable.
mcpx-basic-memory	Durable narrative/project memory, markdown notes, scoped project context	High-volume vector analytics or graph relations	High	Low-medium (file/database backed)	One fetch path appears anchored to main project; prefer search_notes/read_note APIs.
mcpx-chroma	Local vector store fallback and filtered retrieval with metadata	Collection forking on local backend	Medium-High	Low (query operations fast in local run)	Local backend lacks fork support; lifecycle APIs otherwise stable.
mcpx-archon-http	Project/task/document/version workflow orchestration	Instant high-recall semantic retrieval without ingested sources	Medium-High	Medium (health p95 ~5.3ms; MCP health p95 ~23.3ms)	RAG features require sources; no-source state returns empty sets.
mcpx-surrealdb-http	Structured graph/record operations and custom SurrealQL workflows	Bursty/high-frequency MCP calls without backoff	Medium	Low endpoint health latency; local RPC auth path needs tuning	Observed 429/rate-limit behavior and subsequent transport instability in this run.
